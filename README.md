# Distribution_Factors
Code of the project Calculation of Distribution Factors - PTDF and LODF

Distribution factors are used mainly in security and contingency analysis. They are used to approximately
determine the impact of generation and load on transmission flows. Objective of this project is to calculate
two of such factors - Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) and Load Outage Distribution factor (LODF).
PTDF calculates a relative change in power flow on a particular line due to a change in injection and
corresponding withdrawal at a pair of busses and LODF calculates a redistribution of power in the system
in case of an outage. Additionally, sparse matrix techniques are used in MATLAB to handle large power
systems efficiently.
